# Refactored API24 Class Structure

The large API24 class has been refactored into smaller, focused classes for better readability and maintainability.

## New Class Structure

### Core Classes

1. **API24** (`class-api24.php`)
   - Main API handling class
   - Handles API connections, categories, and products fetching
   - Uses Product_Factory for product creation
   - Uses Product_Data_Builder for data processing

2. **Product_Factory** (`class-product-factory.php`)
   - Factory class for creating products
   - Determines whether to create simple or variable products
   - Delegates to appropriate creator classes

3. **Simple_Product_Creator** (`class-simple-product-creator.php`)
   - Handles creation of simple WooCommerce products
   - Manages product attributes, images, and categories

4. **Variable_Product_Creator** (`class-variable-product-creator.php`)
   - Handles creation of variable WooCommerce products
   - Manages variations and their attributes
   - Uses Asaki_Attribute_Manager for asaki variations

### Helper Classes

5. **Product_Helper** (`class-product-helper.php`)
   - Common product operations shared between creators
   - Handles attributes, categories, images, and existence checks
   - Manages taxonomy creation and term handling

6. **Asaki_Attribute_Manager** (`class-asaki-attribute-manager.php`)
   - Specialized handling of asaki variations
   - Implements Stack Overflow solution for "Any" attribute prevention
   - Manages term creation, association, and parent product setup

7. **Product_Data_Builder** (`class-product-data-builder.php`)
   - Processes raw API24 data into structured arrays
   - Extracts prices, images, attributes, and other product data
   - Validates required fields

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
- **Easier Testing**: Smaller classes are easier to unit test
- **Better Maintenance**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated
- **Improved Readability**: Code is organized logically with clear separation
- **Reusability**: Helper classes can be reused across different contexts
- **Reduced Complexity**: Large methods broken into manageable pieces

## Preserved Functionality

All existing functionality has been preserved:
- ✅ Simple product creation
- ✅ Variable product creation with asaki variations
- ✅ Stack Overflow solution for preventing "Any asaki" issues
- ✅ Georgian-to-English slug conversion
- ✅ Image handling and gallery processing
- ✅ Category assignment and hierarchy
- ✅ Attribute management and taxonomy creation
- ✅ Logging and debugging functionality

## Usage

The refactored code is backward compatible. The main API24 class interface remains the same:

```php
$api24 = new API24();
$api24->create_products(); // Works exactly as before
```

The internal implementation now uses the new class structure for better organization and maintainability.
